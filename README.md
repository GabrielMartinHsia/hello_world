# hello_world
My first repository

ok here I'm typing on github, after clicking the pencil icon...


Ooooohh, look at that, there's a green bar! (now I'm in VS, editing locally)...

Now, to upload to github:

1. save changes here.
2. open a terminal (here in VS), and type: git status ... should see in red: "modified: README.md"
3. in the terminal, type: git add README.md ... git will track the changes...
4. in the terminal, again type: git status ... should now see in green: "modified: README.md"
5. now, in the terminal type: git commit -m "brief comment about this commit's changes or whatever"
6. finally, in the terminal, type: git push and enter your password to push these edits back out to github...
